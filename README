This is the project for CS433 Operating Systems. More information will be posted later.

A Good Program will use 10% of its code 90% of time.

We will assume:
  1000 pages of code in each of our programs.
  10,000 pages needed for one run of program.
  first 100 pages are the most used at 9,000 references.
  pages 100-999 are used 1,000 times.
  The pages needed to run the program are a refernce string inside an array 10,000 long. The first index is the first page needed to run the program, 
  and the last index is the last page needed to run the program.

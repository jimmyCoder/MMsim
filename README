A Good Program will use 10% of its code 90% of time.

We will assume:
  100 pages of code in each of our programs.
  10,000 pages needed for one run of program.
  first 10 pages are the most used at 9,000 references.
  pages 10-99 are used 1,000 times.
  The pages needed to run the program are a reference string inside an array 10,000 long. The first index is the first page needed to run the program, 
  and the last index is the last page needed to run the program.

The class shortProgram contains an array of integers, which will signify the pages in the resident set. Each algorithm--optimal, LRUA, and random--needs to use this
constructor to perform the algorithm to make testing consistent and simple.

The Test.java class creates 100 different shortPrograms that are random, good, or very structured. Then each algorithm is tested with resident set sizes 15-30,
which can be tweaked in the class. The results are printed in a document named tests.txt

With the results gathered, we just need to write the paper and talk about it!
